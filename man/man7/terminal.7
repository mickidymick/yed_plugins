.SS terminal-color5
Attribute string to use for color5. Defaults to &magenta.
.SS terminal-color6
Attribute string to use for color6. Defaults to &cyan.
.SS terminal-color7
Attribute string to use for color7. Defaults to &gray.
.SS terminal-color8
Attribute string to use for color8. Defaults to &gray.
.SS terminal-color9

Attribute string to use for color14. Defaults to &cyan.
.SS terminal-color15
Attribute string to use for color15. Defaults to &white.
.SS terminal-color-default
Attribute string to use for deafult text. Defaults to &active.
.SS terminal-color-default-inactive
Attribute string to use for deafult text when the terminal is not in the active frame. Defaults to &inactive.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS term-new
Open a new terminal buffer. New terminal buffers are named *term#, where # is a positive integer starting at 0.
.SS term-open [#]
Opens a terminal buffer and displays in a frame acquired by calling special-buffer-prepare-focus.
If # is provided, use *term# (creating it if it doesn't exist).
Otherwise, a new terminal is created.
.SS term-open-no-frame [#]
This command behaves the same as term-open, but does not call special-buffer-prepare-focus and instead uses the currently active frame.
.SS toggle-term-mode
Turn term mode ON/OFF for the current terminal buffer. See NOTES for information about term mode.
.SS term-mode-off BUFFER
Turn term mode OFF for the terminal buffer BUFFER.
.SS term-mode-on BUFFER
Turn term mode ON for the terminal buffer BUFFER.
.SS term-feed-keys BUFFER KEYS...
Send each key in KEYS to the terminal buffer BUFFER.

Example: term-feed-keys *term0 l s enter
.SS term-feed-text BUFFER TEXT
Send each character in TEXT to the terminal buffer BUFFER.

Example: term-feed-text *term0 "ls\\n"
.SS term-bind KEY CMD ARGS...
Bind KEY to execute CMD ARGS... when in a terminal and in term mode.
.SS term-unbind KEY
Remove terminal key binding for KEY.

A terminal buffer in "term mode" behaves less like a yed buffer and more like a terminal.
Keys presses go through the terminal's input handling and mostly bypass other yed/plugin functionality.
If term mode is turned off via toggle-term-mode, the buffer behaves like a normal yed buffer that can
be scrolled, yanked from, searched, and all the other nice things that you can do with yed buffers.
Note, however, that the terminal buffers are read-only (only the terminal plugin modifies the buffers),
because manipulating the contents otherwise would desynchronize the state of the terminal with the
programs running in it.

By default, ctrl-t is bound in the terminal to toggle-term-mode.

Key bindings are inserted into a new keymap called "terminal".
