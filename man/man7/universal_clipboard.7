In order for this plugin to work your terminal emulator must support the osc 52 escape sequence. To test this paste the following line into a shell, if hello world is now in your clipboard, then your terminal is supported.

printf "\033]52;c;$(printf "%s" "hello world" | base64)\a"

Multiplexers such as screen and tmux can hinder operation. Tmux does work if you put the following two commands into your ~/.tmux.conf .

set -g set-clipboard on

set-option -ag terminal-overrides ",*:Ms=\\E]52;c;%p2%s\\7"
